## About

Financial stability is a state in which you're confident in your means, and typically don't worry about paying your living expenses. It's a goal that many strive for, but it is usually the result of several years of dedicated work and strategical planning. However, this mindset can be learned from a young age. 

This tool will provide a game-like experience for young adolescents to encourage their financial responsibility while collaborating with their parents. The goal of this feature is to promote a healthy environment for children to learn while having support from their parents. 

## Features

- JFrame to present game, parent point of view, and child point of view.

- Parent Point of View
  - Deposit money into the child's account to encourage positive rewards
  - Message the child to encourage positive reinforcement
  - Check Transactions to see a child's progress
  - Add a new parent to encourage multiple points of view for supervisiion
  - Parent settings to change the difficulty, read more about the game, or even add bank information
 
 - Child Point of view
    - Roll for a Life Event, which will cause the child to either have to save or spend money
    - Check the Global status of the top 3 game players
    - Check the status of their current savings account
    - Check messages that their parents or guardians have sent to them

## Future work

Currently, this project only shows student and parent points of view. Ideally, this could be a competition among all players and the winners get to open an account with PNC with their winnings, which will encourage them to do well and save.
